# CCS811 library
This is an Arduino library for the CCS811 digital TVOC/eCO2 Sensor by CCMOSS/AMS. It allows the sensor to output tVOC and eCO2 values. Environmental calibration using values from an external temperature and relative humidity sensor is also possible. NTC thermistor pins or circuit is not used for environmental calibration.

Breakout board available [here] (https://github.com/AKstudios/CCS811-Breakout).
